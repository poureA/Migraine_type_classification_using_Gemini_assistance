# Migraine_type_classification_using_Gemini_assistance

ðŸš€ Exploring Google AI in Data Science & Machine Learning!

I'm excited to share a recent hands-on experience combining Data Science, Machine Learning, and Google Colabâ€™s Gemini AI assistant.

Iâ€™ve always been curious about the claim that Gemini can guide you through an entire ML project using only prompt-based instructions â€” so I decided to test it out by building a Migraine Type Classification project. Here's a quick summary of the process:

ðŸ”¹ Retrieved the dataset from Kaggle. Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gzdekzlkaya/migraine-symptom-dataset-for-classification
ðŸ”¹ Uploaded it to Google Colab and activated Gemini
ðŸ”¹ Prompted Gemini to walk through the full ML pipeline â€” from data loading to model training and saving â€” all within a Jupyter notebook
